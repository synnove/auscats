[title] Social engineering is.
[contents] The 'art' of utilizing human behaviour to breach security
Without the participant (or victim) even realizing
that they have been manipulated

[contents] "Technology-Based Approach" deceive the user
into believing they are interacting with a 'real' computer system
to extract personal information

[title] Technology-Based Example
[contents] The user gets a popup window, informing him that the
computer application has had a problem and the user will need to
reauthenticate in order to proceed. Once the user provides his
id and password on that pop up window, the harm is done.
The hacker now has the user id and password.

Step 2) Developing Relationship]  aggressor develops trust with the victim
Step 3) Exploitation]  target is manipulated by trusted aggressor to revel
information or perform an action
Step 4) Execution]  once the target has completed the task the cycle is complete

[title] How to avoid social engineering schemes?
[contents] 1) Do not open any emails from untrusted sources. Be sure to contact
a friend or family member in person or via phone if you ever receive an email
message that seems unlike them in any way.
2) Do not give offers from strangers the benefit of the doubt.
If they seem too good to be true, they probably are.
3) Lock your laptop whenever you are away from your workstation.

5) Read your company privacy policy to understand under what circumstances you can or
should let a stranger into the building.
